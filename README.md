**Knapsack-Based Investment Portfolio Optimization**

This Java application optimizes investment portfolios using the 0/1 Knapsack algorithm to maximize returns while staying within a specified risk tolerance.

**Overview**
The project applies the classic 0/1 Knapsack algorithm to the investment domain, where:

1. Each investment option has a risk factor (weight) and an expected return (value)
2. The total risk tolerance represents the knapsack capacity
3. The goal is to select the optimal combination of investments to maximize returns while staying within risk tolerance

**Features:**
**Multiple Optimization Algorithms:**
1. Dynamic Programming (optimal solution)
2. Greedy approach by highest returns
3. Greedy approach by best return-to-risk ratio
4. Diversified portfolio with sector constraints

**Investment Management:**
1. Load investment options from CSV files
2. Create custom investments interactively
3. Save investment portfolios

**Analysis Tools:**
1. Compare performance across different algorithms
2. Analyze risk-return trade-offs
3. Evaluate sector allocation and diversification

Algorithms
Dynamic Programming (Knapsack)
Generates the mathematically optimal solution
Time complexity: O(n*W) where n is the number of investments and W is the risk capacity
Space complexity: O(n*W)
Greedy Approaches
Faster but potentially suboptimal solutions
Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Two variations implemented:
Highest return first
Best return-to-risk ratio first
Diversified Portfolio
Adds sector constraints to prevent overexposure
Uses a brute force approach with exponential complexity
Limited to smaller portfolios due to computational constraints
Extensions
The project includes several extensions beyond the basic knapsack problem:

Sector Diversification: Limits allocation to any single sector
Interactive Portfolio Creation: Build custom investment portfolios
Performance Analysis: Compare different optimization strategies
File I/O: Import and export investment data

Key Concepts
The Knapsack Problem
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where:

You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value
You need to select items to maximize total value while staying within a weight capacity
Each item can only be selected once (0/1)
Application to Portfolio Optimization
In our financial context:

Investments are the items
Risk factors are the weights
Expected returns are the values
Risk tolerance is the knapsack capacity
This approach allows us to find the combination of investments that maximizes returns while staying within an acceptable risk level.

Algorithm Implementation Details
Dynamic Programming Solution
java
// Pseudocode for the dynamic programming approach
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int w = 0; w <= W; w++) {
        if (i == 0 || w == 0)
            dp[i][w] = 0;
        else if (weight[i-1] <= w)
            dp[i][w] = Math.max(value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w-weight[i-1]], dp[i-1][w]);
        else
            dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
    }
}
Sector Diversification Constraints
The diversification approach adds sector constraints to ensure no single sector exceeds a specified percentage of the portfolio. This is implemented by tracking sector allocations and enforcing maximum thresholds during the optimization process.

Future Enhancements
Add support for fractional investments (Fractional Knapsack)
Implement modern portfolio theory with covariance matrices
Add visualization tools for portfolio performance
Support for multi-period investment optimization
Incorporate Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment
